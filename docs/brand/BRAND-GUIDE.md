# OpenPaw — Brand Guide 🐾

## Name
**OpenPaw** — one word, capital O, capital P. Never "Open Paw" or "openpaw" in prose.

## Tagline
**"AI that just works."**

Secondary: "The friendly side of AI."

## Elevator Pitch
OpenPaw is a free, open-source Mac app that gives you a personal AI assistant with zero technical setup. Download, open, connect your accounts, done. It handles your email, calendar, messages, and digital life — all running privately on your device.

## Voice & Tone
- Friendly, warm, approachable
- Confident but never arrogant
- Simple language, no jargon
- Slight playfulness (🐾)
- Never corporate, never "enterprise"
- Think: a really smart friend who happens to be great with technology

## Logo Concept
- A paw print 🐾 with subtle circuit/digital elements
- Or: a simple paw print where one pad is a power/play button
- Clean, minimal, works at 16x16 favicon size
- Color: warm coral/orange (#FF6B4A) on white, or white on dark

## Color Palette

| Name | Hex | Use |
|------|-----|-----|
| Paw Orange | #FF6B4A | Primary brand, CTA buttons, logo |
| Warm White | #FFF8F5 | Backgrounds |
| Soft Black | #1A1A2E | Text, dark mode background |
| Ocean Blue | #4A90D9 | Links, secondary actions |
| Success Green | #4ADE80 | Confirmations, status |
| Muted Gray | #9CA3AF | Secondary text, borders |

## Typography
- **Headlines:** SF Pro Display (system font, no download needed)
- **Body:** SF Pro Text
- **Code:** SF Mono
- Why system fonts: zero load time, native feel, consistent with macOS

## Emoji Usage
- 🐾 is the brand emoji. Use it in headers, social, GitHub.
- Keep it to 1-2 per post. Don't overdo it.

## Relationship to OpenClaw

OpenPaw is a downstream consumer of OpenClaw. Think:
- Linux kernel → Ubuntu
- Chromium → Chrome
- VS Code → Cursor

OpenPaw makes OpenClaw accessible to everyone. If OpenClaw wants to acquire/merge, the architecture is designed for clean integration. OpenPaw could become the official consumer tier of OpenClaw.
